QUESTION 1: 
Given a string, return a new string that replaces every occurrence of 
the word "important" with "urgent":
let advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet 
dinosaur."; 
==== ==== ==== ==== ====
ANSWER 1: 
Use the .replace() method of String. 
CODE:
let advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training 
your pet dinosaur."; 
advice.replace('important', 'urgent');
console.log(advice);
Few things in life are as urgent as house training your pet 
dinosaur.
 
Other examples of string replacement include using reular 
expressions as follows:
let str10 = "Welcome message: Hello World! hello world! Hello, 
hello, hello"; 
str10.replace('hello', 'hi'): Welcome message: Hello World! hi world! Hello, hello, hello
str10.replace(/hello/, 'hi'): Welcome message: Hello World! hi world! Hello, hello, hello
str10.replace(/hello/g, 'hi'): Welcome message: Hello World! hi world! Hello, hi, hi
str10.replace(/hello/gi, 'hi'): Welcome message: hi World! hi world! hi, hi, hi
str10 remains unchanged: Welcome message: Hello World! hello world! Hello, hello, hello
 
The same can be achieved using objects to map replacements and 
functions in .replace:
mapObj is: cat:kitty,dog:pooch,goat:billy
regular expression used is: /cat|dog|goat/gi
str12 original: I have a cat, a dog, a mouse, and a goat.
str12 is now: I have a kitty, a pooch, a mouse, and a billy.
mapObj is: cat:kitty,dog:pooch,goat:billy,mouse:snake
regular expression used is: /cat|dog|goat|mouse/gi
str12 is now: I have a kitty, a pooch, a snake, and a billy.
